#  Belgium Gets Slot Machines in Ocean City – 1988

In the summer of 1988, the boardwalk in Ocean City, NJ added arcade games and slot machines in response to a rise in tourism. One of the most popular tourist destinations on the East Coast, Ocean City was looking for ways to draw more people in and also keep them there for longer periods of time.

The addition of arcade games and slot machines was a hit, with people of all ages spending hours at a time playing games and trying their luck at the slots. While some people were opposed to the changes, the majority saw it as a way to add excitement to their trip.

It wasn’t long before other beach towns followed suit, adding arcade games and slot machines to their boardwalks and piers. Today, these types of amusement arcades are commonplace at coastal resorts, giving visitors another fun activity to enjoy while on vacation.

#  Ocean City Gambling Goes Live in Belgium – 1992

On July 1st, 1992, the Belgian town of Ocean City went live with its first ever gambling operation. The casino, which was located in the heart of town near the pier and boardwalk, proved to be a popular destination for tourists and residents alike.

The casino featured a range of games including blackjack, roulette, and poker, as well as a number of slots and other electronic gaming machines. It quickly became a go-to spot for those looking to enjoy some excitement and gamble away their hard-earned money.

The casino was a major boon to the local economy, generating millions of dollars in revenue each year. It also created hundreds of jobs in the town, many of which were filled by locals.

The casino proved to be so successful that it spawned a number of copycats in other Belgian towns. In fact, by the late 1990s there were more than two dozen casinos across the country. This helped make Belgium one of the most gambling-friendly countries in Europe.

While the future of gambling in Belgium is currently uncertain due to new EU regulations, there's no doubt that Ocean City was one of the pioneers in this now-thriving industry. Thanks for everything, Ocean City Casino!

#  First Casino Turned On in Belgium at Ocean City – 1995

The first casino in Belgium was turned on at Ocean City in 1995. This casino was a major attraction for the city, and it quickly became one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.

Belgium had been considering legalizing casinos for some time before this, but there was some resistance to them from local officials. However, when Ocean City opened its doors, it was clear that casinos could be a major boon to the economy.

Since then, other casinos have opened in Belgium, and the industry has continued to grow. There are now dozens of different casinos in the country, and they continue to attract thousands of visitors every year.

Casinos in Belgium offer a wide variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. They also offer many different types of promotions and bonuses, which help to attract new players.

The Belgian casino industry is currently worth several hundred million euros per year, and it is expected to continue growing in the years to come. This makes it an attractive destination for tourists and investors alike.

#  Major Development Leads to Gambling Boom in Belgium and Ocean City – 2002

The early 2000s saw a gambling boom in Belgium and Ocean City as major development projects were completed. These new casinos and resorts brought in tourists from all over the world and generated billions of dollars in revenue.

The most notable development was the opening of the Conrad Casino Resort in 2002. This luxury hotel and casino complex was the largest in the world at the time, with over 1,000 rooms and gaming tables. It quickly became a popular destination for players from around the globe.

The success of the Conrad Casino Resort led to a wave of development projects in both Belgium and Ocean City. New casinos and resorts were built, and existing ones were upgraded or expanded. This led to a significant increase in tourism traffic to both destinations.

The gambling boom was a big boon for the economies of both Belgium and Ocean City. The casino resorts employed thousands of people, and their spending generated billions of dollars in revenue for local businesses. The hotels, restaurants, shops, and other businesses all saw an increase in profits as a result of the gambling boom.

The gambling boom came to an end in 2007, when the global financial crisis hit. This caused tourist traffic to decline significantly, leading to job losses and reductions in business revenue. However, the legacy of this period is still evident today, with many of the casinos and resorts that were built during that time remaining popular tourist destinations
