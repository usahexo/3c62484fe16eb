#  State of Nevada Leads the Nation in Mobile Sports Wagering Revenue

A recent report from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC shows that Nevada sportsbooks generated $227.4 million in revenue from mobile and online betting during the 2017 fiscal year. This accounted for more than a third of the state’s overall sports betting revenue and marked a steady increase from the $206.9 million generated in 2016.

Nevada has been at the forefront of the legalized sports betting movement, and its early adoption of mobile and online platforms has helped it maintain its dominant market position. In fact, the state’s overall sports betting revenue is still significantly higher than that of any other jurisdiction in the United States.

The growth of mobile wagering is not surprising, as it offers several advantages over traditional methods. For one, it allows players to place bets from anywhere without having to go to a physical location. This is especially helpful for those who do not live near a casino or who cannot get there easily. Additionally, mobile bets can often be placed more quickly and easily than those made in person.

This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, as more states legalize sports betting and more players shift to mobile platforms. Nevada is well positioned to take advantage of this growth and could see its total sports betting revenue increase even further.

#  Pennsylvania Sees Huge Increase in Mobile Sports Wagering Revenue

PA mobile sports betting generated $19.6 million in revenue in November, up from just $3.5 million in October. This is a 447% increase and is likely due to the start of the NFL season.

There are now 10 sportsbooks operating in the state, and Penn National Gaming says that its Hollywood Casino in Grantville saw a “significant increase” in betting volume last month.

Pennsylvania is one of eight states with legalized mobile sports betting and it trails New Jersey, which generated $24.8 million in revenue in November.

It will be interesting to see if Pennsylvania can keep up the growth; New Jersey’s mobile sports betting market has been experiencing some consolidation recently.

#  Maryland Records Second Highest Mobile Sports Wagering Revenue

The State of Maryland released its FY 2018 Annual Gaming Report, which showed that the state generated record revenue from mobile sports wagering.

The report revealed that Maryland’s six casino and racetracks generated a combined $48.5 million in revenue from mobile sports wagering in fiscal year 2018, up from the $24.5 million generated in fiscal year 2017. This represented a 98% increase in revenue from mobile sports betting.

The top earners were Ocean Downs Casino & Racetrack, which generated $11.8 million in mobile sports wagering revenue, and Hollywood Casino Perryville, which generated $10.4 million.

Maryland’s General Assembly authorized a five-year trial for legal sports betting in 2018, and the results so far have been very positive. The state has seen an increase in overall gaming revenues, and the addition of mobile sports betting has helped to drive this growth.

The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency is now looking into ways to expand the state’s legal sports betting offerings, including adding online casino games and expanding its current list of authorized casino operators.

#  Oregon Tops the List for Most Mobile Sports Wagering Revenue Per Capita

Oregon takes the top spot for most mobile sports betting revenue per capita, generating $9.08 in revenue for every resident of the state in 2018.

 Nevada falls in second place,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) with an estimated $7.68 generated per capita, followed by New Jersey at $7.08. Delaware and Pennsylvania round out the top five, generating $5.14 and $4.06 per capita, respectively.

These findings come from a recently released study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, which analyzed state-by-state data on mobile sports betting revenue from January through October 2018.

The study found that overall, U.S. states took in $283 million in revenue from mobile sports betting during that time period, with an average of $2.48 generated per capita.

“We continue to see strong growth in mobile sports betting revenue as more states launch offerings and more bettors move their activity to smartphones and tablets,” said Chris Grove, research director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming. “As we head into 2019, we can expect continued growth in this area as more states come online and more bettors take advantage of the convenience and ease of betting from their smartphones and tablets.”

Though just 10 states currently offer mobile sports betting, that number is expected to grow in 2019 as additional states legalize the activity.

#  Colorado Ranks Fourth in the Country for Mobile Sports Wagering Revenue

In 2017, Colorado generated $7.9 million in revenue from mobile sports betting. This ranked the state fourth in the country for mobile sports wagering revenue. Nevada topped the list with $215.9 million, followed by New Jersey ($178.8 million) and Pennsylvania ($107.0 million).

Colorado’s strong performance is due in part to its large population of bettors. The state has a population of 5.6 million, which is larger than all but six other states in the country. In addition, Colorado has a thriving sports culture, with teams in all four major professional sports leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL).

The popularity of mobile betting is also a factor. In 2017, 56% of all bets on sporting events in the United States were placed through mobile devices, according to Statista . This number is only projected to grow in coming years, as more and more people opt for convenience over traditional methods such as visiting a brick-and-mortar casino or betting through a bookmaker.

The growth of mobile betting is good news for Colorado’s casinos and gaming industry as a whole. In 2016, total casino gaming revenue in Colorado was $915 million , generating thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity. With mobile sports betting expected to continue growing at a rapid pace, this number can be expected to grow in future years.
