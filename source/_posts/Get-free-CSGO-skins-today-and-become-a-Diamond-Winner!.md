CSGO stands for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It is a first person shooter game that pits teams of terrorists and counter-terrorists against each other in a variety of game modes. The game has come a long way since it was first released in 2012.

One of the main reasons CSGO is so popular is the fact that it is a free-to-play game. You can download and play it without spending any money. However, some people do choose to spend money on skins, stickers, and other cosmetic items to make their characters look cooler.
