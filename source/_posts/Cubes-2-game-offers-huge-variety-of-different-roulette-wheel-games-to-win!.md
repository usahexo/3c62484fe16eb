#  How to win different roulette games in Cubes 2?

There are tons of different roulette games that can be played in Cubes 2 and each one offers its own set of challenges and opportunities. In this article, we will take a look at how to win different roulette games in Cubes 2.

The most basic roulette game is the European version, which features a single zero slot on the wheel. This game can be won by betting on either red or black and covering half of the bets with each color. For example, if you want to bet $10 on black, you would put $5 on black and $5 on red. If the ball lands on black, you win $10, since you have half of your bet at that number plus the other half of your bet at the next number up (19).

If the ball lands on red, you would lose $10, since you have half of your bet at that number minus the other half of your bet at the next number down (-19).

The American version of roulette features two zero slots on the wheel and is therefore much more difficult to beat. However, there are still ways to make money playing this game. One popular strategy is known as “the Martingale system”.

With this system, you start by betting a small amount of money (e.g. $1), and then doubling your bet after every loss. So if you lose your first bet, you would then bet $2, if you lose that then you would bet $4 etc. If you eventually win a bet, you go back to betting your original amount ($1).

This system can be used with any even money bet (e.g. red/black, odd/even) and it gives players a chance to win their money back plus some extra profit if they stick with it long enough.
