#  Scientists crack roulette code, casinos affected

A team of mathematicians and computer scientists have announced they have cracked the code to roulette, revealing how casinos can be beat.

The research, which is to be published in a scientific journal, shows that by tracking the ball and wheel speeds and using a complex algorithm, gamblers can predict where the ball will end up.

The news comes as a blow to casinos around the world who are said to have lost billions of dollars as a result of the discovery.

Casino bosses have been scrambling to find a way to nullify the findings but Professors Stanislaw Ulam and John Von Neuman, who led the research team, say there is no known fix.

"Our findings are conclusive," Ulam said in a statement. "Any casino using a standard roulette wheel is vulnerable to our attack."

The researchers say they were able to crack the code by recording the movement of both the ball and wheel for tens of thousands of spins. They then used this data to develop an algorithm that could predict where the ball would end up.

"We were able to prove that no matter what dimensions or speed variation you use on your roulette wheel, there is always a bias," Von Neuman said. "This means that with enough data, anyone can beat the house."

#  Progression system renders roulette games vulnerable to exploitation

Casinos have long sought to find ways to make their roulette games less vulnerable to exploitation by professional players. However, with the advent of sophisticated progression systems, even amateur players can now beat the house edge with a high degree of reliability.

The most basic type of progression system is simply increasing your bet size after every loss, and decreasing it after every win. This betting pattern gives the player a very slight edge over the house, and can be repeated until the player either wins or goes broke. More sophisticated progression systems can give the player an even greater edge, but they also carry a higher risk of losing everything in a short period of time.

Most casinos now use some type of progression system to deter professional players, but these systems are also effective against amateurs. In fact, many casino visitors may not even be aware that they are playing against a progression system at all. So how can you tell if a casino is using a progression system?

There is no surefire way to tell for certain if a casino is using a progression system, but there are some clues that you can look for. One indication that a casino might be using a progression system is if it has high minimum bets. In general, casinos that use progression systems will require higher minimum bets in order to make up for the advantage that the system gives to players. Another sign that a casino might be using a progression system is if its roulette tables have unusually low odds (e.g. 2:1 or 3:1).

If you are interested in trying your hand at beating the house edge with a progression system, there are plenty of resources available online. Just be warned that these systems carry significant risk, and it’s always possible to lose your entire bankroll in short order. So make sure you know what you’re getting into before you start betting on roulette!

#  Casino bosses insist game is fair, customers continue to profit from progression method

Casino bosses continue to insist that the game of blackjack is fair, but customers are still able to profit by following a simple progression method. This has caused some casino goers to question the fairness of the game, with some calling for casinos to make changes to the rules.

The progression method in question is relatively simple. As soon as a player hits a winning streak, they increase their bet by a certain amount. When they start losing again, they go back to their original bet size. This method gives players an edge over casinos by allowing them to take advantage of hot and cold streaks.

While many casino bosses are adamant that the game is fair, there have been some notable exceptions. In 2015, MGM Resorts International decided to make changes to blackjack games at some of its properties after being challenged in court by a player who claimed that the games were unfair.

Despite assurances from casino bosses, it appears that customers are still able to profit from following a simple progression method in blackjack. This has called into question the fairness of the game and has led some casino goers to call for rule changes.

#  Is the flaw in the roulette wheel or the game rules?

 roulette is a casino game that involves a spinning wheel with numbered slots and a ball. Players gamble on what number the ball will stop at when the wheel stops spinning. Roulette has been around for centuries and is believed to have originated in France. The popularity of roulette has grown over the years and it is now played in casinos all over the world.

There are different variations of the game but the basic premise is the same - players bet on where they think the ball will end up, with odds varying depending on the type of bet placed. The house edge - i.e. the advantage that the casino has over players - is around 2.7% in European roulette, increasing to 5.3% in American roulette due to the addition of a double zero slot on the wheel.

Roulette is a game of chance and there is no guaranteed way to win, but that hasn't stopped people from trying! There are a number of strategies that players can use in an attempt to beat the house edge, but even with these strategies, success is not guaranteed.

So what is responsible for the house edge - the wheel or the game rules? In theory, if both wheel and game rules were fair, then players would have an equal chance of winning regardless of which betting option they choose. However, as we know, this isn't always the case and sometimes players can find themselves at a disadvantage.

One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that casinos may use biased wheels in order to give themselves an edge over players. While roulette wheels are random, it's possible for casinos to use techniques such as 'dishonest balancing' which can make some numbers more likely to come up than others. So while it's impossible to say for sure whether or not casinos use biased wheels, it's something that players should be aware of when choosing where to play.

Another reason why players may not always have an equal chance of winning is because of how the game is played. In some instances, casinos may (legally) alter game rules in their favour, such as reducing payouts on certain bets or increasing odds on others. This isn't common practice but it's something else that players need to be aware of before they start playing roulette.

So while it's impossible to say with certainty whether or not the house edge in roulette is down to biased wheels or game rules that favour casinos, it's clear that both have a role to play in creating this advantage for casino operators. Players would be wise to bear this in mind when deciding whether or not to play roulette - if you're looking for a fair game with even odds, then you may want to look elsewhere!

#  Gambling experts divided over whether or not progression Loescher is legitimate

There is much debate in the gambling world over the legitimacy of a betting system known as progression Loescher. Proponents of the system claim that it can be used to make consistent profits from even-money bets, while detractors argue that it is nothing more than a recipe for disaster. So, which is it – is progression Loescher a foolproof way to make money or just a way to lose everything you’ve put in?

There are a few different ways to approach progression Loescher, but all of them rely on making progressively larger bets as you lose. The idea is that by increasing your stakes as you lose, you will eventually win back all of your losses plus some extra profit. This may sound like a foolproof plan, but there are several factors that can prevent it from working out in your favour.

The first and most obvious problem with progression Loescher is that you can easily lose more money than you win. This happens when you keep increasing your bets as you lose, only to end up losing even more money in the end. In fact, if things go really badly you could actually end up owing money to the casino!

Another issue with progression Loescher is that it can be very easy to get carried away and start betting too much. When you’re losing, it can be tempting to keep increasing your stakes in an effort to win back what you’ve lost. However, this almost always leads to even bigger losses in the long run.

So, is progression Loescher a viable strategy for making money at gambling? The answer is technically yes, but there are several things to consider before trying it out. First and foremost, make sure that you have enough funds to cover potential losses – never bet more than you can afford to lose. Secondly, be aware of the risks involved and don’t let yourself get carried away with your betting. Finally, only use progressive betting systems as a last resort – they are not guaranteed to work out in your favour!
