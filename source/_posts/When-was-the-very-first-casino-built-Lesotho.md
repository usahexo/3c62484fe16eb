#  When was the very first casino built Lesotho?

The first casino built Lesotho was the Casino Revolution, which opened in late 2015. It is located in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho.

#  Who designed and built the casino?

The casino was designed and built by an unknown architect.

#  What type of casino was it?

There are three types of casinos: land-based, riverboat, and Indian Casinos. The casino where the events transpired was likely a riverboat or Indian Casino as they are the only types of casinos that offer electronic gaming machines (EGMs).

#  How popular was the casino?

The casino was very popular. The casino industry is a $US45 billion industry and it employs over 1.5 million people. Casinos are found in almost every state in America and around the world.

#  Why did it close?

The Toys "R" Us chain of stores has filed for bankruptcy, and announced that it plans to close all of its U.S. stores. This has left many parents and children wondering what this means for the future of their favorite toy store.

There are a number of reasons why Toys "R" Us may have decided to close its stores. One possibility is that the company was unable to keep up with competition from online retailers such as Amazon. Another reason could be that Toys "R" Us had too much debt, which made it difficult for the company to make money.

Whatever the reason may be, the closure of Toys "R" Us stores will likely have a significant impact on the toy industry. Many smaller toy stores may struggle to stay open in the face of competition from online retailers. And larger toy companies, such as Mattel and Hasbro, may see their profits decline as shoppers shift their spending to online outlets.

It's unclear what the future holds for Toys "R" Us, but one thing is sure: the closure of its stores will have a major impact on the toy industry.
