The Arizona Diamondbacks are a professional baseball team that competes in the National League of Major League Baseball (MLB). The team was founded in 1998 and is based in Phoenix, Arizona. The Diamondbacks play their home games at Chase Field.

The Diamondbacks have had some success over the years, winning the National League West division in 2001 and 2007. However, the team has yet to win a World Series championship. The Diamondbacks are hoping to change that in 2018, and they could have a good chance to do so, as they currently have one of the best rosters in baseball.

#  Arizona Diamondbacks odds to win World Series revealed

The Arizona Diamondbacks have been revealed as the early favorites to win the 2019 World Series.

According to Oddshark, the D-backs have 6-1 odds of taking home their first championship since 2001. They currently have the third-best odds in all of baseball, trailing only the Boston Red Sox (5-1) and Los Angeles Dodgers (7-2).

Arizona is coming off a 95-win season that saw them finish second in the National League West. They were knocked out of the playoffs by the Dodgers in a 3-1 series loss.

This offseason, they made a few big moves, acquiring infielder Eduardo Escobar from the Twins and outfielder Steven Souza Jr. from the Rays.

They also re-signed starting pitcher Clay Buchholz and reliever Brad Boxberger.

The Diamondbacks will open their season on March 28th against the Colorado Rockies.

#  Sports betting could help the Diamondbacks snag a postseason berth

The Diamondbacks have been one of the most pleasant surprises in baseball this season, largely due to their stellar play in the first half. Arizona got off to a scorching start, thanks in part to their potent offense and surprisingly competent pitching staff.

However, the Diamondbacks have come back down to earth in recent weeks, with their record currently sitting at 54-48. While they are still in contention for a postseason berth, they will need to make a push in the second half if they want to qualify for the playoffs.

One way that the Diamondbacks could improve their chances of reaching the postseason is by increasing their involvement in sports betting. There is no doubt that hot streaks and slumps can vary significantly in baseball, making it a particularly interesting sport to bet on.

By placing some bets on their favorite teams, Diamondback fans could help to increase the team’s win total and bring them one step closer to playoff glory. Not only would this motivate the players on the field, but it would also give the fans something to cheer for during the second half of the season.

There is no question that sports betting can be a fun and exciting activity, but it can also be a profitable one. If you are looking for a new way to get involved with the Diamondbacks this season, then consider placing some bets on their games. You may be surprised at how much money you can make by doing so!

#  MLB commissioner weighs in on legality of online sports betting

On Tuesday, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred addressed the topic of legalized sports betting in the US at the annual GM meetings.

“I don’t really have a reaction to it as a policy matter,” Manfred said, according to ESPN. “I think we are all subject to the laws of the states in which we operate. Our view is that legalization is going to happen in the United States. It’s just a question of when and how.”

The Supreme Court is currently hearing a case on the legality of sports betting, with a ruling expected by June. If the Court rules in favor of legalized betting, it would be up to each state to decide whether or not to allow it.

Many baseball teams already have an ownership stake in casinos, and some have raised concerns that legalized betting may compromise the integrity of the game. However, Manfred believes that such concerns are overblown.

“The reality is if you have an event that is corrupted, it’s corrupted regardless of whether or not there’s legal Sports Betting involved,” he said.

Manfred also dismissed suggestions that legalized betting would negatively impact attendance or TV ratings.

“My personal view is that [legalized betting] will be additive both to fan interest and to viewership, but I understand people who take a different point of view,” he said.
